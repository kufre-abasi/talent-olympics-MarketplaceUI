## Understanding Polkadot

Polkadot, represented by the ticker DOT, is a multi-chain application environment that enables different blockchains to interact seamlessly. Created by Ethereum's co-founder, Gavin Wood, in 2016, Polkadot provides an ecosystem where multiple blockchains can co-exist and interoperate.

## Why is Polkadot Important?

Polkadot addresses two critical challenges in the blockchain technology world - interoperability and scalability. Its advanced protocol allows the exchange of any type of data or asset across different blockchains. This unique capability has earned it the moniker of an 'Ethereum killer'.

Polkadot's native token, DOT, is used for governance, staking, and bonding within its ecosystem. The protocol doesn't cap its supply, initially allowing the creation of 10 million DOT, which was later redenominated to 1 billion DOT tokens in August 2020.
